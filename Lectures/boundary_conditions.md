Boundary conditions in simulations define how a system interacts with its surroundings, influencing the behavior of the simulation at its boundaries. There are several types:

- Dirichlet Boundary Condition: Specifies the value of the solution variable (e.g., temperature, velocity) at the boundary.

- Neumann Boundary Condition: Specifies the derivative of the solution variable at the boundary, often representing flux or heat transfer.

- Periodic Boundary Condition: Assumes that the simulation domain repeats periodically, allowing information to flow freely between opposite boundaries.

- Wall Boundary Condition: Models interactions with solid boundaries, reflecting or absorbing particles, fluid flow, or energy.

- Inlet/Outlet Boundary Condition: Specifies the flow conditions at boundaries, such as fluid velocity, temperature, or pressure.

Each boundary condition type is chosen based on the physical behavior being modeled and the specific requirements of the simulation
