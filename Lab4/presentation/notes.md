# Creeping (Stokes) Flow:
    Creeping flow refers to a regime in fluid dynamics where viscous forces dominate over inertial forces. In this regime, the flow is very slow, and the fluid particles move smoothly without turbulence.
    In terms of appearance, creeping flow typically exhibits smooth and steady flow patterns with no visible turbulence or vortices.
    Reynolds number (Re) for creeping flow is very low, usually much less than 1. It's generally considered to be in the range of Re<0.1Re<0.1 to Re≈1Re≈1.

# Vortex Trail:
    Vortex trail, also known as the Von Kármán vortex street, occurs when a fluid flows past a bluff body (like a wedge) at moderate Reynolds numbers. It results in the formation of alternating vortices downstream of the body.
    In this flow regime, vortices are shed alternately from each side of the body, forming a pattern resembling a series of vortices that trail behind the body.
    The flow exhibits periodic shedding of vortices and can become highly turbulent.
    The Reynolds number for vortex shedding typically ranges from around Re≈40Re≈40 to Re≈200Re≈200, depending on the shape and size of the body.

# Attached Vortices:
    Attached vortices occur at higher Reynolds numbers when the flow past a bluff body becomes turbulent. Instead of shedding vortices periodically like in the vortex trail regime, vortices form and persist along the body's surface.
    These vortices remain attached to the body and can significantly affect the flow characteristics, including pressure distribution and drag.
    The appearance of attached vortices includes the presence of coherent structures along the surface of the body, which can sometimes be visualized using flow visualization techniques like smoke flow or dye injection.
    Reynolds numbers for attached vortices typically range from Re≈200Re≈200 to several thousands, depending on factors such as the body's shape, surface roughness, and flow conditions.

These Reynolds number ranges are approximate and can vary depending on the specific geometry of the body and the flow conditions. It's essential to consider the context and specific parameters of your simulation to determine the appropriate Reynolds numbers for each flow regime accurately.s
